Updated CSS to make hamburger menu always visible and centered after the banner title section. Navbar starts collapsed by default and expands when hamburger is clicked. Added hamburger menu button and JavaScript functionality to all HTML pages (index, leader, entrepreneur, creator, tutor, contact, projects, skills, privacypolicy, terms-conditions) for consistency. About dropdown works properly with click-to-toggle on mobile and hover on desktop.",
