  "summary": "Added a visible dropdown icon (▼) to the About navbar link across all pages to indicate it has a dropdown menu. Added CSS styling for the dropdown icon with rotation animation on hover/focus (desktop) and JavaScript to rotate the icon when dropdown is toggled on mobile. The Leader link was already correctly positioned only in the About dropdown menu and not as a separate navbar item. Updated all HTML pages (index, leader, entrepreneur, creator, tutor, contact, projects, skills, privacypolicy, terms-conditions) to include the dropdown icon on the About link with proper functionality.",
  "current_status": "Dropdown icon (▼) added to About link on all pages. Icon rotates when dropdown is opened on mobile and on hover/focus on desktop. Leader link remains correctly positioned only within the About dropdown menu. All pages updated consistently with working dropdown icon functionality."
