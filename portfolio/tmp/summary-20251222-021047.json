  "summary": "Fixed dropdown icon rotation issue - icon now properly resets to closed state (rotate(0deg)) when dropdown is closed. Added resetDropdownIcon() function that is called when menu closes, when other nav links are clicked, and when hamburger menu closes. Improved dropdown item styling on mobile with left border and indentation to better distinguish dropdown items (Leader, Entrepreneur, Creator, Tutor) from top-level nav items. Updated JavaScript on all HTML pages with improved toggle logic that properly checks dropdown state. The Leader link is correctly positioned only within the About dropdown menu in the HTML structure.",
