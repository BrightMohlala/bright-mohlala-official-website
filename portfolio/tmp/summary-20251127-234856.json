  "summary": "Fixed dropdown menu visibility issue. The problem was that the professional-banner-container had overflow: hidden which was clipping the dropdown menu. Changed overflow to visible on professional-banner-container, header, and nav-wrapper. Also increased dropdown z-index to 10000 and added margin-top for better spacing. The dropdown menu should now be visible when hovering over the About link.",
  "current_status": "Dropdown menu visibility fixed. Changed overflow properties to allow the dropdown to display properly. The About dropdown menu should now be visible on hover/click across all pages."
